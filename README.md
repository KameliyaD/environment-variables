Deleted Environment Variable on Windows 8.1
Hello everyone! This is for all you who've accidentally deleted the variable path e.g C:\Windows\system32...
I've experienced this when I tried to install Java and you probably have the same case.
There are plenty of suggestions how to restore the value of this variable however I found that the right solution is already on your System Settings.I say right because Microsoft has already provided a way to bring the system in the past. Basically erasing all the changes you've made before deleting the path.
